        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            Sandeep Kaur Kuttal is an Associate Professor at North Carolina State University where she directs the Human-Centric Software 
            Engineering Lab.
            She was Assistant Professor at The University of Tulsa, where she also directed the Human-Centric Software 
            Engineering Lab. Her research combines Human-Computer Interaction, Software Engineering, and Artificial Intelligence. She 
            focuses on the human aspects of software engineering by studying and modeling programmer behavior and then designing and developing 
            mixed-initiative programmer-computer systems. Sandeep is a recent recipient of the NSF CAREER and AFOSR YIP awards.
            She also recieved a letter from the U.S. Senator James M. Inhofe, congratulating her for receiving the YIP award. She has received a 
            best paper award at ACM CHI, best paper at ACM/IEEE ICGSE, and an honorable mention at ACM CHI. She is on the editorial board of the 
            Journal of Computer Languages, vice-chair of the steering committee for the IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing 
            (VL/HCC), and acted as chair or  program committee member at CHI, VL/HCC, HCII, ICSE, FSE, ASE, ICST, ICSME, CHASE, ICPC, and IUI. She is 
            passionate about diversity and inclusion.
            
            <br><br>
            She is actively involved in diversity and inclusion through her teaching, research, and service. She was Vice President 
            for Community Outreach as well as Professional Development at the Tulsa North-Eastern Oklahoma Society of Women Engineers 
            (Tulsa SWE). At TU, she was the faculty advisor for the SWE, Young Professionals of TU, and National Center for Women in Information 
            & Technology (NCWIT). Sandeep Kaur Kuttal has been invited to elementary, middle, and high schools to motivate students in STEM. These acts help in 
            positively impacting the field of CS and engineering, increasing recruitment, and retention.
