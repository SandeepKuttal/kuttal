            <div><h3>International Research Community Activities</h3></div>
                    I am very active in the HCI, SE and HCI-AI research communities and participate in the meetings organized to shape 
                    the future directions of my research areas. I review approximately 50 research papers each year.  Also, I am an organizing 
                    member of approximately >5 conferences each year. I am a member of the editorial board for Journal of Computer Language, Vice 
                    Chair as well as member of the steering committee for the IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing,  
                    Board Member for International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Human-Computer Interaction and International Conference on 
                    Applications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I have served as session chair and program committee member for major 
                    conferences (e.g., CHI, UIST, VL/HCC, ICSE, FSE, ASE). I have presented my research at top-tier conferences and was invited to give talks.
