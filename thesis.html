            <h3>Helping Users Utilize Software Engineering Techniques (Ph.D. Thesis)</h3>
            <p>
            It is known that end users do not design upfront. When end-user programmers
			create programs their design decisions and coding activities are interlaced. Later, as
			requirements emerge and change, end users opportunistically employ reuse to support
			their applications. While reusing, they need to explore and search for examples with
			desired qualities, select the most appropriate example and understand it, and possibly
			debug it.<br><br>
			 
			Previous studies have found large instances of clones in the repositories,
			underlining the fact that cloning is a common mechanism for reuse among
			end users. Moreover, end users debug their programs into existence. They employ
			their past successful or unsuccessful strategies to debug their programs. All these
			end-user activities tend to create variations and need to be supported to facilitate
			programming tasks. Hence to facilitate end user's programming ventures I have lead research in 
			 following projects:

            <h4>Support for Variation over Space: AppInventorHelper</h4>
            <p>
                <b><FONT COLOR="920000">Project Description:</FONT></b> End users with little formal programming background are creating software in
                <img src="images/graphviewcopy.png" width="15%" align="right" />	  			
                many different forms, including spreadsheets, web macros, and web mashups. End-user
                programming environments allows end users to create programs, but end users still
                face various programming barriers due to lack of software engineering support in
                these environments. One source of support known to be beneficial for professional
                developers with their programming ventures is variation management. Variation
                management deals with managing variations over time and space. We believe that
                leveraging variation management we can help end users with programming tasks,
                including program exploration, program understanding, verification and debugging.
                This research intends to provide novel ways of integrating variation management into
                the existing work flow of end users and help them create programs more effectively
                and efficiently.

			To better understand the usage of variants by end-user programmers, we conducted
            an online survey. Based on the requirements gathered from the survey, we designed, prototyped, and implemented 
            variation managment support to a visual programming environment for mobiles (App Inventor), called "AppInventorHelper", 
            variants of applications automatically, in a manner that allows users to utilize the advantages of variation management without needing to be aware of the underlying
            functions known to professional programmers.  We modified the code of open source project, App Inventor, to support variation management in the environment. 
            To achieve that I have used GWT, Java and MySQL for implementing the variation wraper. The visualization wrapper  will be designed using PHP, d3.js libraries, 
            Ajax and JSON. Controlled user study of 10 participants was conducted to assess the effectiveness of our variation management support into end user environment. 
            The study helped us to understand the behaviors that end users engage in with and without the support of AppInventorHelper. It also helped us to understand end users'
            usability experiences with AppInventorHelper, and discover ways in which AppInventorHelper
            could be improved.

     		Mashup programming environments provide central repositories to end users where			
			they can store their mashups. However, current environments do not provide facilities
			by which users can keep track of the versions or provenance of the mashups they
			create. In the professional software engineering community, versioning is widely acknowledged
			as beneficial for activities such as code understanding, change traceability,
			debugging and maintenance. Providing Versioning will help in giving the end user 
			flexibility in backtracking, trying alternative ideas and going back to successful
			state. Versioning also helps in reuse and debugging. <br> <br>
					
     		
     		To implement versioning support, we create a proxy wrapper. This proxy wrapper intercepts the JSON code
			(pipe) that is transmitted between the user's client running in their browser and
			the Yahoo! Pipes server. This allows "Pipes Plumber" to be operational for most web
			browsers (including Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox and Safari).
			<img src="images/architecture1.png" width="200" height="140" align="left" />
     		We use a proxy server (Squid 3.1.4) to manage communications between the client (web browser) 
     		and the Yahoo! Pipes server Using the Internet Content Adaptation Protocol (ICAP), a proxy 
     		wrapper intercepts the request and response messages exchanged between a client and the 
     		Yahoo! Pipes server. When the user requests the user interface (UI) of Yahoo! Pipes, 
     		the response related to the UI is redirected to the proxy wrapper. The proxy wrapper 
     		modifies the response messages of the UI by inserting "widgets" related to versioning 
     		and debugging into the UI of Yahoo! Pipes before delivering the message to the client.<br>
 			
 			With two formative studies we found that versioning benefit computer science and end user participants in:
			1) reducing learning barriers, 2) helping them reuse parts of pipes, and 3) improving
			their debugging performance.<br> <br>

     		<li>Our overall research approach for supporting versioning can

			Our approach involves identifying and defining intuitive features useful for

            <h4>Debugging Support for End-User Mashup Environments</h4>
            
            <b><FONT COLOR="920000">Project Description:</FONT></b>
     		Mashups are situational applications which interact with web which is a complex ecosystem 
     		<img src="images/lensview.png" width="15%" alt=""  align="left" />
     		of heterogeneous formats, services, protocols, standards and languages all of which tend 
     		to evolve. A further complication involves the interfaces by which mashups are created: 
     		mashup environments facilitate mashup creation by providing visual interfaces, which 
     		abstract the underlying code as black box features. The problems related to bugs in mashups 
     		are exacerbated by the typical programming practices used to create mashups. 
     		One implication of the foregoing data is that debugging of
			mashups is important. Such debugging, however, intrinsically
			involves distance and visibility issues due to distributed and
			black box dependencies, and this renders it time and effort
			intensive.<br><br>
			
     		
     		To assess the occurrences of bugs in Yahoo! Pipes programs,
     		<img src="images/total.png" width="150" height="140" alt="" align="left" />
			we examined a large corpus of pipes. To do this we wrote
			a web crawler in java that collected unique pipe identifiers using a
			snowball sampling approach. 
			This process retrieved 25,734 unique pipe identifiers. For
			each identifier we obtained the code for the pipe. We classified
			<img src="images/architecture.png" width="270" height="200" alt="" align="right" />
			the type of anomalies which can occur in the wire-oriented mashups.
			To investigate the issues involved in debugging mashups, and
			approaches that may make the task easier for mashup programmers,
			we have implemented enhanced support for debugging
			in the Yahoo! Pipes environment. Our approach
			involves providing techniques for detecting the presence of
			bugs in pipes, and providing feedback to mashup programmers
			that can help them locate and correct bugs more efficiently
			and effectively.<br>
			
			Our user study showed that it was difficult for end users to identify and localize faults
			without debugging support. We also observed that bugs related to program nesting,
			silent failures of programs, and program reuse were the hardest for end users to
			localize. Debugging enhancements greatly helped mashup programmers localize and
			efficiently fix bugs.

			<li>We identify specific classes of faults found in Yahoo! Pipes
			programs that can be used directly, or as a starting point,
			for identifying fault classes in other end-user programming
			domains, including web-development and visual programming
			paradigms.
			<li> We provide empirical results about the classes of faults that
			arise because of program nesting, silent failures of programs,
			and program reuse and their effects on debugging
			by end users; these too have implications for attempts to
			apply our approach to other domains.
			<li> We provide guidelines about the implications of the above
			effects on design and debugging support in end-user programming
			domains that generalize beyond Yahoo! Pipes
			to other programming environments.
			<li> Finally, we illustrate an overall research approach that can
			be applied in other programming environments to help enduser
			programmers. This approach involves a methodology
			for identifying fault classes, defining and implementing detectors
			for faults in those classes, creating appropriate messages
			about detected faults and providing instructions for
			fixing those faults.

            <h4>End User Debugging Behavior from an Information Foraging Theory Perspective</h4>

                <b><FONT COLOR="920000">Project description: </FONT></b>
                We studied the behavior of 16 web active endusers. Multiple insights were derived
                <img src="images/IFTModel.png" width="220" height="220" alt="" align="left" />
                from the data including the findings that there were two loops (finding and fixing) that
                were entwined and that users had some common strategies/behaviors while debugging.
                We derived a new IFT model through iterative analysis of the data and the codes by
                following the tenets of grounded theory. We ultimately extended the IFT model for
                debugging. Our extended model allows us to obtain a refined understanding of the
                debugging behavior by separately focusing on the localization and correction of faults.
                For each phase, a userâ€™s foraging behavior during debugging involves the following
                steps: (1) find cues, which are then processed into scents, 
                (2) navigate through patches,
                (3) catch prey, and (4) â€œverifyâ€ the viability of the prey. <br>
                
                We found that the cues differ in how well they: 1) add conceptual clarity to error messages, 
                2) promote detectability, 3) connect users with relevant debugging information, and 4) narrow
                the search space for users. We also discovered several ways in which mashup programming environments, and
                end-user programming environments in general, can be enhanced to provide better cues
                in order to support end usersâ€™ debugging strategies.
